# Weather-app

Learn whats the weather in a city. 

Input a city name and fetch its weather (a gif too), temperature, humidity with weather and gif APIs ( async await, .then ), display the time it took to fetch.

Note: Since the search is by city name, same name city searches could get the undesired city.
